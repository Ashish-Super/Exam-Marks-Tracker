The Exam Marks Tracker is a client side web application designed to help students manage and evaluate their examination performance. 
Users can enter marks for multiple subjects across Unit and Periodic Tests. The system validates inputs, calculates totals and 
percentages, and presents both exam wise and subject wise performance summaries. Data is stored in browser local storage for offline 
access. The application also supports editing records, deleting entries, and exporting reports as PDF and JSON backups. The project demonstrates 
efficient front end development and real world data management using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
